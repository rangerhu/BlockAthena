WarpFinance Hack Summary

On December 17, 2020, WarpFinance—a DeFi protocol for stablecoin lending—was exploited in a sophisticated flash loan attack.

Attack Time:
- UTC: 2020-12-17 19:00–20:00
- Ethereum Block Range: ~11,540,000 to ~11,542,000

Attack Details:
- The attacker exploited a vulnerability in WarpFinance's vault accounting logic.
- By using flash loans, the attacker manipulated the collateral value of LP (liquidity provider) tokens.
- This allowed them to borrow more stablecoins than they should have been able to, draining approximately $7.7 million worth of stablecoins (mostly DAI, USDC, USDT).

Modus Operandi:
- The attacker executed multiple flash loans and interactions with WarpFinance in a single transaction bundle.
- After the protocol was exploited, funds were moved to intermediary wallets.
- Portions of the stolen assets were later returned after WarpFinance negotiated with the attacker.

Notable Characteristics:
- The attack involved complex multi-step transactions and large-volume flash loans.
- Timing and address behaviors suggest automated orchestration and precise control over multiple contracts and accounts.
